## Requirements

In order to use this extension you will need the following things before going to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section:

- An installed version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- A Twitch account for yourself or a separate one to be used as a chat bot ([sign up here](https://www.twitch.tv/signup))
- While logged in as your own account or as a separate account go to this site to generate a token for the chat bot: http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi
  - Save this token temporarily in a safe place as you will need it later in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=clarkio.twitch-highlighter)
2. Open your VS Code settings

   - Keyboard shortcut: `CTRL/CMD + ,`

3. Type in "twitch" into the search bar
4. Find the `Twitch Highlighter: Channels` setting and enter the name of the channel(s) to which you'd like the extension to connect. Example: `clarkio` If you'd like to connect to more than one channel separate them by commas `,`. Example: `clarkio,parithon`
5. Save your changes and close that tab. Go back to the Settings UI tab.
6. Find the `Nickname` setting. If you are using your own account for the chat bot then enter your account username as the value here. If you created a separate account use that username. Save your changes.
7. In the status bar, click the "Disconnected" button. After clicking it, you'll see a notification that the extension is missing Twitch Credentials.
8. Click the "Set Credentials" button
9. You'll now see a prompt in the top middle of VS Code asking you to enter your Twitch Client Id. This is what you copied and saved from earlier. Copy and paste the value into this prompt and press `Enter`
10. Next you'll be prompted to enter your Twitch token. This is the secret you copied and saved from earlier. It should be a value prefixed with `oauth:`. Copy and paste the secret into this prompt and press `Enter`
11. Click the `Disconnected` button and you should see notifications indicating the extension is starting and finally started listening to the Twitch chat.

## Twitch Commands

To highlight a line, use:

        !highlight <LineNumber> OR !line <LineNumber>

To unhighlight a line, use:

        !line !<LineNumber>

To highlight multiple lines, use the same syntax as above but include a range of lines to highlight:

        !line <StartLineNumber>-<EndLineNumber>

Additionally, you can also include comments:

        !line <LineNumber> This is a comment
